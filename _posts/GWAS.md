The development of high throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies, as well as statistical methods, makes it possible to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. In [6], I identified a causal missense mutation in the MC1R gene for coat color using GWAS analysis. In [7], I identified copy number variants (CNVs) in a population of 1,036 individuals and found a substantial level of CNV diversity. The follow-up validation indicated complex relationship between CNV and pigmentation [8]. In [9â€“11], I identified many genomic regions for production and body conformation traits by using GWAS, while the subsequent gene expression analysis revealed more than 1000 genes involved in phenotypic variation. These works highlight the potential of functional genomics to uncover genomic loci associated with both Mendelian and complex traits, meanwhile emphasizing that the importance of exploring regulatory architecture underlying complex traits.
