- *Harmonizing public data for molecular QTL mapping*
  Molecular QTL mapping, such as e/sQTL, histone QTL, and methylation QTL, accessibility QTL, protein QTL, plays a crucial role in linking disease-associated variants to gene regulatory mechanisms within the inherent context of cells, physiological states, and disease conditions. Hence, my primary research will center on building biobank-scale resources by pan-tissue sample collection spanning diverse physiological stages in individuals, encompassing both healthy and diseased states, and representing varied genetic backgrounds worldwide. Through the integrative analysis of this context-specific data with resources such as GTEx, dGTEx, NHP dGTEx, and FarmGTEx, I aim to delve into the dynamic regulatory impact of genetic variants on multi-dimensional omics layers (e.g. transcriptome, methylation, chromatin accessibility, histone modification, protein and metabolites) across various tissues and disease states (short-term). I will explore context specificity of molecular QTLs between healthy and disease states, aiming to identify disease-causing variants, target genes and pathways. To better integrate this extensive data, I will conduct computational pipelines by taking into account the state-of-the-art methods and latest versions of all the software and datasets. In summary, my research will significantly enhance our comprehension of disease etiology and facilitate the translation of genetic discoveries into therapeutic applications.
- *Integrative epigenomics*
  Molecular QTLs commonly found proximal to Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) are closely linked with genomic regulatory regions, such as enhancers, promoters, silencers, and insulators, governing gene regulation. Notably, over 90% of GWAS hits reside outside of coding regions, underscoring the significance of genetic variation in regulatory regions as major contributors to phenotypic variations in complex traits through the regulation of gene expression. Integrative epigenome analysis offers deeper insights into how genetic variants impact regulatory elements, consequently shaping phenotypic variations. My research aims to delve into the genetic causality underlying human diseases by harnessing extensive epigenomic datasets from ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, FAANG, alongside newly generated data (mid-term). Specifically, I will generate and analyze context-specific epigenomic data (e.g., disease states) to predict traits relevantly tissues/cells, identify potential causal variants and tissue regulatory elements, ascertain candidate target genes, and unravel gene regulatory circuitry. To comprehensively dissect the implications of genetic variants, gene expression, and regulatory elements in complex traits and diseases, I will develop relevant methodologies, such as employing deep-learning algorithms to better integrate these datasets. Furthermore, my research will consistently prioritize the inclusion of single-cell analysis across all investigations to enhance resolution and precision. Collectively, my research will unravel the intricate molecular mechanisms influencing disease susceptibility, contributing significantly to our understanding of gene regulation dynamics and their profound implications for human health and disease.
